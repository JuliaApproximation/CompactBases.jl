# Diagonal operators

Diagonal operators are operators that only depend on the coordinate;
they are also called local operators. They act on a function to
produce a new function as

```math
L f(x) = f(x)g(x)
```

Typical examples are potentials, such as the Coulomb potential ``V(x)
= Q/x``, generated by a charge ``Q``. This potential is not
polynomial, i.e. we cannot compute its matrix elements exactly using
Gauß quadratures, but with high enough order and intelligent placement
of the nodes, we can get sufficient accuracy.

In orthogonal bases, such as finite-differences and FE-DVR diagonal
operators are represented by diagonal matrices, whose elements
coincide with the values of the function evaluated at the nodes,
whereas in B-splines they are banded (with the bandwidth decided by
the polynomial order).

We can construct diagonal operators in two ways:

1. From a scalar-valued function
2. From a vector of expansion coefficients

## Construction from scalar-valued function

The first way consists of constructing a `QuasiDiagonal` object
representing the function broadcast along the continuous dimension of
our quasimatrix:

```jldoctest
julia> f = x -> sin(2π*x);

julia> rmax,k,N = 10.0,7,71;

julia> r = Inclusion(0..rmax)
Inclusion(0.0..10.0)

julia> qf = QuasiDiagonal(f.(r))
QuasiDiagonal{Float64,QuasiArrays.BroadcastQuasiArray{Float64,1,var"#3824#3825",Tuple{Inclusion{Float64,IntervalSets.Interval{:closed,:closed,Float64}}}}}(QuasiArrays.BroadcastQuasiArray{Float64,1,var"#3824#3825",Tuple{Inclusion{Float64,IntervalSets.Interval{:closed,:closed,Float64}}}}(var"#3824#3825"(), (Inclusion(0.0..10.0),)))
```

We can then project this onto a specific basis:

```jldoctest
julia> R = FiniteDifferences(1:N, rmax/(N+1))
Finite differences basis {Float64} on 0.0..10.0 with 71 points spaced by Δx = 0.1388888888888889

julia> F = R'*qf*R

As indicated above, for uniform finite-differences the matrix elements
coincide with the function values at the nodes:

```jldoctest
julia> norm(diag(F) - f.(CompactBases.locs(R)))
0.0
```

For B-splines, the situation is complicated by the fact that the basis
functions are non-orthogonal:

```jldoctest
julia> R = BSpline(LinearKnotSet(k, 0, rmax, N))
BSpline{Float64} basis with LinearKnotSet(Float64) of order k = 7 on 0.0..10.0 (71 intervals)

## Construction from existing expansion coefficients

Now, assume that we already know ``f(x)`` expanded over the basis
function ``B_i(x)`` of our basis:

```math
f(x) = \sum_i f_i B_i(x)
\iff
\ket{f} = \sum_i f_i \ket{B_i}
\iff
\ket{f} = B\vec{f}
```

where

```math
B \defd
\bmat{\ket{B_{1}} & \ket{B_{2}} & \dots & \ket{B_{n}}}.
```

We wish to find the matrix elements of the matrix representing the
linear operator that acting on ``1`` gives ``f(x)``:

```math
\operator{L}1 = f(x),
```

i.e. we are in some sense trying to solve

```math
\mat{L}\vec{o} = \vec{f}
```

for ``\mat{L}``, where ``\vec{o}`` is the expansion coefficients of
``1`` in our basis.

The most straightforward way is via the Vandermonde matrix ``V``

```math
f(\vec{x}) = \mat{V}\vec{f}
```

where ``\vec{x}`` the vector of interpolation points (quadrature
nodes). The matrix elements of the linear operator are then simply
computed by quadrature

```math
\mat{L}_{mn} = \matrixel{B_m}{f(\vec{x})}{B_n}
```

For the orthogonal bases, where ``B_m(x_k)=\delta_{mk}``, this matrix
reduces to

```math
\mat{L}_{mn} = \delta_{mn}f(x_m),
```

as noted above. If we want to explicitly compute the matrix
representation of a [`DiagonalOperator`](@ref), we can do so using
[`Matrix(L::DiagonalOperator, args...)`](@ref).

_However_, we may also consider an alternative approach, that is
basically the same as the one described in the section on
[Densities](@ref); what we are trying to achieve is a linear operator
that when acting on a function produces the product of two functions
expanded on the same basis. We may therefore employ the same routine
as we use to find the mutual densities, but _without_ conjugating the
first function (the one corresponding to the diagonal operator). This
approach is illustrated in the following example.

### Example

As an example, we consider the calculation of

```math
g(r) = \operator{L}f(r),
```
where ``f(r)=r`` and
```math
\begin{aligned}
\operator{L} &= V(r) =
(\alpha r^2 + \beta r)
\exp(-3r/2),
&
\begin{cases}
\alpha&\approx0.314269680527354,\\
\beta&\approx0.20951312035157,
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```
which is a kind of potential that arises in Coulomb repulsion between
two electrons.

Now assume we know the expansion coefficients of ``V(x)`` _as a
function_ in a certain basis, and we wish to turn it into _an
operator_ that we can act on vectors of expansion coefficients of
other functions. We can find this operator using the helper object
[`DiagonalOperator`](@ref), which takes a vector of expansion
coefficients and computes function products using
[`FunctionProduct`](@ref) as outlined above. Additionally, it supports
updating the operator from a new set of expansion coefficients via
`copyto!(::DiagonalOperator, ::AbstractVector)`; this is useful if the
vector of coefficients are updated in an iterative procedure.  Using
this helper object, it is very easy to construct the linear operator
corresponding to ``V(r)``:
